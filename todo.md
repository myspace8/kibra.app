- Performance: For large question sets (e.g., WAEC exams), consider lazy loading or pagination.
- Add the customization to the user table
- To customize the data retrieved from the Supabase query for a student user, you can tailor the query and its output based on the student's needs, preferences, or context. Below are several ways to customize the data from the `exams` table for a student, along with practical approaches to implement these customizations:

### 1. **Filter by Student-Relevant Criteria**
   Customize the query to return exams that align with the student's profile, such as their academic level, subjects of interest, or exam difficulty.

   - **By Subject(s)**: If the student is enrolled in multiple subjects, use `.in()` to filter exams for those subjects.
     ```javascript
     const studentSubjects = ["Physics", "Chemistry", "Mathematics"];
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, exam_source, subject_id, question_count, total_marks, difficulty")
       .in("subject", studentSubjects);
     ```

   - **By Difficulty Level**: Filter exams based on the student's proficiency level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
     ```javascript
     const studentLevel = "beginner";
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty")
       .eq("difficulty", studentLevel);
     ```

   - **By Tags**: If the `tags` column contains metadata like topics or exam types (e.g., "mechanics", "organic chemistry", "mock"), filter exams by tags relevant to the student’s study focus.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, tags")
       .contains("tags", ["mechanics"]);
     ```

   - **By School or Exam Metadata**: Use `school_exam_metadata` or `waec_exam_metadata` to filter exams specific to the student’s school or curriculum.
     ```javascript
     const studentSchool = "Example High School";
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, school_exam_metadata")
       .eq("school_exam_metadata.school_name", studentSchool);
     ```

### 2. **Personalize Based on User Exam Metadata**
   If `user_exam_metadata` contains student-specific data (e.g., past performance, completion status, or preferences), you can filter or sort exams to prioritize those most relevant to the student.

   - **Filter Unattempted Exams**: Show only exams the student hasn’t attempted.
     ```javascript
     const studentId = "student_123";
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, user_exam_metadata")
       .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
       .is("user_exam_metadata.completed", false);
     ```

   - **Prioritize Based on Performance**: If `user_exam_metadata` includes scores or progress, sort exams by difficulty or recommend exams based on past performance.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty, user_exam_metadata")
       .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
       .order("difficulty", { ascending: true });
     ```

### 3. **Sort and Limit Results**
   Customize the order and number of exams returned to make the data more actionable for the student.

   - **Sort by Date**: Show the most recent exams first (using `sort_date`).
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, sort_date")
       .eq("subject", "Physics")
       .order("sort_date", { ascending: false });
     ```

   - **Limit Results**: Return a manageable number of exams for the student to focus on.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id")
       .eq("subject", "Physics")
       .limit(5);
     ```

### 4. **Augment Data with Calculated Fields**
   Enhance the returned data with computed values or additional context relevant to the student.

   - **Progress Indicators**: If `user_exam_metadata` tracks progress, calculate completion percentage or score and include it in the response.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, user_exam_metadata")
       .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId);

     const enrichedData = examsData.map(exam => ({
       ...exam,
       completion_percentage: exam.user_exam_metadata.completed_questions / exam.question_count * 100
     }));
     ```

   - **Recommended Exams**: Use logic to recommend exams based on the student’s past performance or preferences (e.g., suggest easier exams if they struggled previously).

### 5. **Dynamic Query Based on User Input**
   Allow the student to specify preferences (e.g., via a form or API parameters) to dynamically adjust the query.

   - **Example**: Let the student select subjects, difficulty, or tags via a frontend interface, then build the query dynamically.
     ```javascript
     const studentPreferences = {
       subjects: ["Physics", "Chemistry"],
       difficulty: "intermediate",
       tags: ["mechanics"],
       limit: 10
     };

     let query = supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty, tags")
       .in("subject", studentPreferences.subjects);

     if (studentPreferences.difficulty) {
       query = query.eq("difficulty", studentPreferences.difficulty);
     }
     if (studentPreferences.tags) {
       query = query.contains("tags", studentPreferences.tags);
     }
     if (studentPreferences.limit) {
       query = query.limit(studentPreferences.limit);
     }

     const { data: examsData } = await query;
     ```

### 6. **Enhance Output Format**
   Format the data to be more user-friendly for the student, such as grouping exams by subject or providing summaries.

   - **Group by Subject**: Organize results for easier browsing.
     ```javascript
     const groupedExams = examsData.reduce((acc, exam) => {
       const subject = exam.subject_id;
       acc[subject] = acc[subject] || [];
       acc[subject].push(exam);
       return acc;
     }, {});
     ```

   - **Summarize Data**: Provide a summary (e.g., total exams, average difficulty).
     ```javascript
     const summary = {
       totalExams: examsData.length,
       averageMarks: examsData.reduce((sum, exam) => sum + exam.total_marks, 0) / examsData.length
     };
     ```

### 7. **Integrate with Student Context**
   Use additional data about the student (e.g., from a `students` table or authentication system) to personalize further.

   - **Fetch Student Profile**: Join with a `students` table to get preferences or academic level.
     ```javascript
     const { data: studentData } = await supabase
       .from("students")
       .select("subjects, preferred_difficulty")
       .eq("id", studentId)
       .single();

     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty")
       .in("subject", studentData.subjects)
       .eq("difficulty", studentData.preferred_difficulty);
     ```

### 8. **Localization and Accessibility**
   Customize the data presentation based on the student’s language or accessibility needs.

   - **Translate Subjects or Metadata**: If the student prefers a different language, map subject names or metadata to their language.
   - **Simplify Output**: For younger students, simplify exam descriptions or highlight key details (e.g., `question_count`, `total_marks`).

### Example Combined Implementation
Here’s a comprehensive example combining several customization techniques:
```javascript
const studentId = "student_123";
const studentPreferences = {
  subjects: ["Physics", "Chemistry"],
  difficulty: "intermediate",
  limit: 5
};

// Fetch student-specific exams
const { data: examsData, error: examsError } = await supabase
  .from("exams")
  .select(`
    id,
    exam_source,
    subject_id,
    question_count,
    total_marks,
    sort_date,
    difficulty,
    tags,
    user_exam_metadata
  `)
  .in("subject", studentPreferences.subjects)
  .eq("difficulty", studentPreferences.difficulty)
  .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
  .is("user_exam_metadata.completed", false)
  .order("sort_date", { ascending: false })
  .limit(studentPreferences.limit);

// Enrich data with completion percentage
const enrichedData = examsData.map(exam => ({
  ...exam,
  completion_percentage: exam.user_exam_metadata.completed_questions
    ? (exam.user_exam_metadata.completed_questions / exam.question_count * 100).toFixed(2)
    : 0
}));

// Group by subject
const groupedExams = enrichedData.reduce((acc, exam) => {
  const subject = exam.subject_id;
  acc[subject] = acc[subject] || [];
  acc[subject].push(exam);
  return acc;
}, {});

return {
  exams: groupedExams,
  summary: {
    totalExams: enrichedData.length,
    subjects: studentPreferences.subjects
  }
};
```

### Notes
- **Error Handling**: Always check for `examsError` and handle cases where no data is returned.
- **Performance**: Be cautious with complex queries or large datasets; use indexes on columns like `subject`, `difficulty`, or `sort_date` for efficiency.
- **Security**: Ensure the student can only access their own data (e.g., filter by `studentId` in `user_exam_metadata` and use Supabase Row-Level Security).
- **Frontend Integration**: Pass the customized data to a frontend interface (e.g., React, Vue) for a student-friendly display, such as a dashboard with filters.



The phrase "90% chance that the student will click on one of them" refers to a **probability goal** for user engagement. It means the objective is to present a selection of exams (from the `exams` table in your Supabase query) such that there is a 90% likelihood that the student will find at least one exam compelling enough to click on and interact with. This is a user experience or behavioral target, not a technical feature of the query itself.

### Breaking It Down
- **90% Chance**: This is a statistical or predictive goal, indicating a high probability (90 out of 100 times) that the student will engage with at least one exam. It’s about optimizing the selection to maximize engagement based on the student’s preferences, behavior, or context.
- **Click on One of Them**: The action of clicking implies the student finds an exam relevant, interesting, or suitable (e.g., based on subject, difficulty, or past interaction data).

### How to Achieve This in the Context of Your Query
To reach this 90% engagement goal, you need to customize the exam selection to align closely with the student’s needs, preferences, or behavior. This can be done by leveraging the data in your Supabase query and applying personalization strategies. Here’s how this ties to your query and how to implement it:

1. **Highly Relevant Filtering**:
   - Use the student’s profile (e.g., subjects, academic level, past performance) to filter exams. For example, if the student is strong in Physics and struggles with Chemistry, prioritize Physics exams or easier Chemistry exams.
     ```javascript
     const studentSubjects = ["Physics", "Mathematics"];
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty, user_exam_metadata")
       .in("subject", studentSubjects)
       .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
       .order("difficulty", { ascending: true });
     ```
   - Filter unattempted exams to increase relevance:
     ```javascript
     .is("user_exam_metadata.completed", false)
     ```

2. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Use `user_exam_metadata` to analyze past performance (e.g., scores, completion rates) and recommend exams that match the student’s skill level or learning gaps.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, difficulty, user_exam_metadata")
       .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
       .gte("user_exam_metadata.score", 70); // Recommend exams for subjects where the student scored well
     ```
   - Incorporate tags to match specific topics the student is studying (e.g., "mechanics" for Physics).
     ```javascript
     .contains("tags", ["mechanics"])
     ```

3. **Optimal Number of Exams**:
   - Display a curated, limited set of exams (e.g., 5–10) to avoid overwhelming the student while ensuring variety. Too many options might reduce the likelihood of clicking.
     ```javascript
     .limit(5)
     ```
   - Use A/B testing or historical click data (if available) to determine the ideal number of exams that maximizes engagement.

4. **Sort by Engagement Potential**:
   - Sort exams by factors likely to drive clicks, such as recent exams (`sort_date`), lower difficulty for struggling students, or exams with high `question_count` for advanced students.
     ```javascript
     .order("sort_date", { ascending: false })
     ```

5. **Predictive Modeling (Advanced)**:
   - If you have access to historical click data or user behavior (e.g., via a `clicks` table or analytics), build a simple recommendation algorithm to predict which exams are most likely to be clicked based on features like `subject`, `difficulty`, or `tags`.
   - For example, calculate a “relevance score” based on the student’s past interactions:
     ```javascript
     const enrichedData = examsData.map(exam => ({
       ...exam,
       relevance_score: calculateRelevance(exam, studentProfile) // Custom function based on student preferences
     })).sort((a, b) => b.relevance_score - a.relevance_score);
     ```
   - If no historical data exists, prioritize exams based on heuristics (e.g., match `difficulty` to the student’s level, prioritize unattempted exams).

6. **Diverse Selection**:
   - Ensure the displayed exams cover a variety of subjects, difficulties, or formats (e.g., mix of `school_exam_metadata` and `waec_exam_metadata`) to increase the chance that at least one appeals to the student.
     ```javascript
     const { data: examsData } = await supabase
       .from("exams")
       .select("id, subject_id, exam_source, difficulty")
       .in("subject", ["Physics", "Chemistry", "Mathematics"])
       .in("exam_source", ["school", "waec"])
       .limit(6);
     ```

7. **Frontend Optimization**:
   - Present exams in a visually appealing way (e.g., highlight subject, difficulty, or estimated time based on `question_count` and `total_marks`).
   - Use clear calls-to-action (e.g., “Start Physics Exam”) to encourage clicks.
   - Example output transformation:
     ```javascript
     const formattedExams = examsData.map(exam => ({
       id: exam.id,
       title: `${exam.subject_id} Exam (${exam.difficulty})`,
       details: `Questions: ${exam.question_count}, Marks: ${exam.total_marks}`,
       action: "Start Exam"
     }));
     ```

### Measuring the 90% Goal
- **Track Engagement**: To verify if you’re achieving the 90% click probability, log student interactions (e.g., clicks on exams) in a Supabase table or analytics system. Calculate the percentage of sessions where students click at least one exam.
  ```javascript
  await supabase
    .from("clicks")
    .insert({ student_id: studentId, exam_id: clickedExamId, timestamp: new Date() });
  ```
- **Iterate**: If the click rate is below 90%, refine the filtering, sorting, or recommendation logic based on which exams are clicked most often.

### Example Implementation
Here’s a complete example combining relevance, variety, and engagement:
```javascript
const studentId = "student_123";
const studentPreferences = {
  subjects: ["Physics", "Chemistry"],
  preferred_difficulty: "intermediate"
};

const { data: examsData, error: examsError } = await supabase
  .from("exams")
  .select(`
    id,
    exam_source,
    subject_id,
    question_count,
    total_marks,
    sort_date,
    difficulty,
    tags,
    user_exam_metadata
  `)
  .in("subject", studentPreferences.subjects)
  .eq("difficulty", studentPreferences.preferred_difficulty)
  .eq("user_exam_metadata.student_id", studentId)
  .is("user_exam_metadata.completed", false)
  .order("sort_date", { ascending: false })
  .limit(5);

// Format for display
const formattedExams = examsData.map(exam => ({
  id: exam.id,
  title: `${exam.subject_id} Exam (${exam.difficulty})`,
  details: `${exam.question_count} questions, ${exam.total_marks} marks`,
  tags: exam.tags.join(", "),
  action: "Start Exam"
}));

return {
  exams: formattedExams,
  summary: `Showing ${formattedExams.length} exams tailored for you`
};
```

### Notes
- **Data Dependency**: The effectiveness of personalization depends on the quality of data in `user_exam_metadata`, `tags`, or related tables. Ensure these fields are populated with meaningful data.
- **Supabase Features**: Use Supabase’s Row-Level Security to ensure students only see their own `user_exam_metadata`.
- **Testing the Goal**: Achieving exactly 90% engagement requires experimentation and data analysis. Start with a smaller goal (e.g., 70%) and iterate based on analytics.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where no exams match the criteria (e.g., return a fallback set of exams or a message like “No exams available, try adjusting filters”).

If you have specific student data, click tracking, or a desired UI format, I can refine this further!
